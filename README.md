# 🎄 Advent Of Code 2023: A Coding Journey

Welcome to my repository for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge. This is not just a collection of solutions, but a testament to the joy of problem-solving, the thrill of learning, and the spirit of the coding season.

The solutions are crafted in the versatile languages of [Python](https://www.python.org/), the efficient [Go](https://golang.org/), and the robust [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), showcasing the unique strengths of each.

## 🎅 The Challenges

Each day's challenge resides in its own cozy folder, aptly named `day-<day>`. Within, you'll find the riddle of the day (`input.txt`) and the triumphant solution (`main.py`, `main.go` or `main.rs`).

## 🚀 Ready, Set, Code!

To embark on this journey, you'll need:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.9.0 or higher, the language of simplicity and power.
- [Go](https://golang.org/) 1.17.1 or higher, the language of efficiency and performance.
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) 1.55.0 or higher, the language of safety and speed.

## 🏃 Let's Go!

To witness the solution of a specific day, use the following command:

```bash
# Python
python3 day-<day>/py/main.py
```

```bash
# Go
go run day-<day>/go/main.go
```

```bash
# Rust
cargo run --manifest-path day-<day>/rs/Cargo.toml
```
